\section{Project Overview}

    Physical infrastructure is a large and complicated subject, encompassing everything from running water to mains electricity. Below I have listed the main features included in physical infrastructure:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Transportation
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Road and highway networks
            \item Mass transit systems
            \item Railways
            \item Canals
            \item Seaports
            \item Airports
            \item Bicycle paths / pedestrian walkways
        \end{itemize}

        \item Energy
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Electrical power network
            \item Natural gas pipelines
            \item Petroleum pipelines
            \item Coal production and processing
        \end{itemize}

        \item Water management
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Drinking water supply
            \item Sewage collection
            \item Drainage systems
            \item Irrigation systems
            \item Flood control systems
            \item Coastal management
        \end{itemize}

        \item Communications
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Postal service
            \item Telephone networks
            \item Mobile phone networks
            \item Television and radio stations
            \item Internet services
            \item Communications satellites
            \item Undersea cables
        \end{itemize}

        \item Solid waste management
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Landfills
            \item Incinerators
            \item Hazardous waste disposal
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\section{The Problem}

    Development of transportation is a very expensive and time consuming process, so being able to evaluate the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of road layouts beforehand would be very beneficial. This project aims to develop a road network simulator that can be used to evaluate the efficiency of inputted designs under a range of different traffic conditions.
