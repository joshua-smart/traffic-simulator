\section{Languages and Frameworks}

    I have chosen to develop this as a web app as this is the most accessible form of application that can run on any web browser. This also fulfils the requirement of a desktop-scale application [\autoref{requirements-GUI}], maintaining support for variable aspect ratios.

    \subsection{JavaScript}

        \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.10\textwidth}

        \end{wrapfigure}

        JavaScript is a web native, interpreted language that runs directly in a browser. It is dynamically typed (which is rectified by the use of TypeScript [\autoref{typescript}], and has the capability to communicate directly with HTML/CSS environments [\autoref{html/css}]. JavaScript is the most popular framework for web development and is utilised in almost all websites.

        Using JavaScript modules a program can be split into many distinct scripts, allowing for improved project management. In this way JavaScript has the capability to mimic the class structure of Java, a paradigm of OOP that I am very familiar with.

    \subsection{TypeScript}
    \label{typescript}

        \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.10\textwidth}

            \includegraphics[width=0.10\textwidth]{ts-logo-512.png}
        \end{wrapfigure}

        TypeScript \cite{typescript} is a superset of the JavaScript language, the main difference being that TypeScript has the capabilities for static typing. I have chosen this as it combines the flexible and powerful components of native JavaScript with the clarity, efficiency and maintainability of statically typed languages. Hopefully this will allow me to write code quickly and cleanly, using my IDE's built-in TypeScript development tools.

        TypeScript compiles into plain JavaScript code and this is what will be running in the browser when the program is loaded.

    \subsection{HTML/CSS}
    \label{html/css}

        \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.10\textwidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.10\textwidth]{html5-css-logo-512-1024.png}
        \end{wrapfigure}

        The HTML and CSS framework will handle most of the GUI visuals and layout. This will interface directly with my JavaScript object code through DOM-manipulation statements. A few important ones are listed below:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \inlinecode{document.querySelector(<string>);} To retrieve a reference to the specified element in the document.

            \item \inlinecode{element.style.<property>;} Allows access to an elements runtime CSS properties to be edited.

            \item \inlinecode{document.createElement(<tag>);} Creates an element with a specified HTML tag that can be subsequently added to the document.

            \item \inlinecode{element.appendChild(<childElement>);} Adds the child element as a sub-element of the parent.

            \item \inlinecode{element.innerHTML;} Accesses the raw HTML contained within the element as a string to be changed or reassigned.

            \item \inlinecode{element.addEventListener(<listener>);} This will be a vital part of my program, allowing code to respond to document events such as clicks, keypresses and scrolls.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{User Interaction}

    As specified in my analysis section, the user input scheme will be based largely off of mouse interactions similar to that of the Mini Motorways computer game [\autoref{mini-motorways}]. The controls are listed in \autoref{user-interaction-specification}:

    \begin{table}[ht]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|p{0.4\textwidth}|p{0.4\textwidth}|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Result}\\
            \hline
            Left-click on existing node and drag to another existing node & Connect a road between the two targeted vertices\\\hline
            Left-click on existing node and drag to empty space & Create new node at the end point and connect with the existing node\\\hline
            Shift-Left-click on empty space & Create new node at the selected point with no connections\\\hline
            Shift-Left-click on existing node and drag & Move the targeted node along the path of the cursor until button is released\\\hline
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{User interactions with graph model}
        \label{user-interaction-specification}
    \end{table}

    \subsection{Graph Structure}

        After exploring the different types of graph structure I have decided to utilise the adjacency matrix structure for this project. Despite the adjacency matrix implementation having less scalable complexities for most functions [\autoref{graph-time-complexities}] it has a large benefit of a constant time edge lookup; since this function will be called many times for each agent in the network I anticipate this implementation will be more efficient in the long term.
