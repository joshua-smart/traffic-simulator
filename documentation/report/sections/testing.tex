\section{Front-end}

    \subsection{Videos}

        As part of the testing process for this project I have produced a video displaying the front-end user interaction. Making use of the majority of features I have implemented. Please note that the keyboard and mouse overlay are for clarity purposes only and not part of the program.

\section{Back-end}

    During the development process I wrote a series of unit tests to validate the major parts of the system, leading to less error-prone and maintainable code. The following index (\autoref{tests-index}) points to the test files in my code base. All the tests pass when executed.
